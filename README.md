# CIFAR10_TASK-5_Tamoghna-Kumar

I took these project due to my interest in machine and deep learning.In these 4 days I have tried to implement various versions of neural networks to classify images in the cifar 10 dataset. I have learned about convolutional neural networks, the effect on accuracy due to the number of hidden layers in a neural network. It took me quite some time to learn about this and implement it. My approach revolved around cnns, mlps and different forms of neural networks on this dataset. I finaly built the neural network but have encountered limitations on creating the log file for it. 

I have created the run.sh file separately for it and my main code for it lies in the cifar10.py file. In the command for running, I have separately created train
